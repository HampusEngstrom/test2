# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Installs the application.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Tasks

\_design/accessibility

- 2pt Responsive design, works on mobile and tablets
- 1pt No UI framework used (such as Bootstrap, Ant)

\_functionality

- 1pt Sort by name and office
- 2pt Only render a set of profiles using either infinity scroll, pagination or a load more button

\_testing/QA

- 2pt End-to-end testing (with an existing framework)
- 2pt Unit tests for existing functionality (reasonable coverage)

# Design

- App.js fetches the data and pass it on to Colleagues.js if successfully fetched. App.js conditionally renders the loading spinner during fetching, Colleagues if success and Error if data could not be fetched.
- DropDown.js is made stateless, to be reusable and used as widely as possible.
- Pagination.js takes a list as render prop and serves it a new modified list after the pagination component has performed its operations, like a container.
- layout/Colleagues/ is the layout component with a useState hook for the items to be presented, in this case sorted.
- Toolbar.js holds the sorting logic and all other logic that would be implemented in the "Potential filter and tools area". It serves its parent Colleagues with the updated items (sorted, filtered, etc).

I've tried to test the components and features as much as possible, using unit tests, integration tests and e2e tests.

# Backlog

- Handling missing images
- Loading spinner when loading colleagues
